This repo contains field notes and playbooks that I used for some Openshift 3.11 Deployments on Amazon Web Services. I have not tested any on this <3.11, and they probably are not applicable with 4.0's architecture changes.

That said, they can probably be backported to recent versions.

These playbooks assume AWS provisioning is already done. Provisioning IaC is in the works.
